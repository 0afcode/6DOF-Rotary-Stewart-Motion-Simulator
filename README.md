# 6DOF Rotary Stewart Motion Simulator Platform
Compact yet powerful motion simulator platform utilizing 6 AC servo motors/planetary gears and a ESP32 microcontroller.

I will make a solid attempt to document this project with sufficent code, videos and wiki entries in order to for a user/(crash test dummy...) to build a fast motion simulator that demands respect. 

## Disclaimer 
This is a DANGEROUS project, and if absolute care is not taken you will be injured or killed.

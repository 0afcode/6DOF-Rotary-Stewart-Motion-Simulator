# 6DOF Rotary Stewart Motion Simulator
Compact yet powerful motion simulator platform

I will make a solid attempt to document this project with sufficent code, videos and wiki entries in order to for a user/(crash test dummy...) to build a fast motion simulator that demands respect. 

## Disclaimer 
This is a DANGEROUS project, and if absolute care is not taken you will be injured or killed.
